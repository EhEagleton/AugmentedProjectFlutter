    <!-- Theme applied to the Android Window as soon as the process has started.
         This theme determines the color of the Android Window while your Flutter UI initializes, as well as behind your Flutter UI while its running.
         This theme is only used if you have defined a windowBackground or no activity in your manifest. If you have an activity in your manifest,
         this theme does not affect the window background of the activity itself.

         The Flutter app will first render its content inside of the AppCompatActivity, which means you
         must provide an empty activity theme that allows the Flutter app to fully take over the screen. -->
